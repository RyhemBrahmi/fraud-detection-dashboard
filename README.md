# fraud-detection-dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project is a web-based fraud detection dashboard built with React. It provides interactive visualizations, filters, and insights to help identify and analyze potentially fraudulent transactions. The dashboard is designed to be responsive, performant, and user-friendly, focusing on real-world fraud detection use cases.

🎯 Features

📊 Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs for fraud detection.

🔍 Search & Filtering: Advanced search and filtering options to refine results.

📂 JSON Data Handling: Uses a JSON file for transaction data.

🎨 Modern UI: Clean and intuitive design with a smooth user experience.

✅ Unit Testing: Ensures code reliability with Jest and React Testing Library.

🛠️ Technologies Used

React.js → Frontend framework for building the UI

Recharts → For interactive data visualization

FontAwesome → Provides icons for better UI/UX

Jest & React Testing Library → Used for unit and integration testing

Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) → For state management

JSON File → Stores and retrieves transaction data

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
